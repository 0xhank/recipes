# React Component Conventions

## Views
- Views represent top-level pages or distinct sections of the application.
- Should primarily compose smaller components and handle routing/page-level state.
- `RecipeSplash.tsx`: Displays the list of recipes, includes search/filter functionality.
- `CreateRecipe.tsx`: Form for adding new recipes (currently uses LLM simulation).
- `RecipeDetail.tsx`: Displays the full details of a single selected recipe.
- `HelloWorld.tsx`: A sample/placeholder view.

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with TypeScript (`React.FC`).
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- Use descriptive names for components and props.

## State Management
- Use the `useRecipeStore` (Zustand) for global recipe state.
- Use `useState` for local component state (e.g., form inputs, UI toggles).

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Apply utility classes directly in the JSX.
- Aim for responsive design using Tailwind's breakpoints (sm, md, lg).
